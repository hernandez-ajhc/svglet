# Contributing to svglet

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **svglet** ❤️

All contributions are welcome — code, documentation, ideas, and discussions.
svglet aims to stay simple, predictable, and framework-agnostic, so please read this guide carefully before contributing.

## 📌 Project Philosophy (Important)

Before contributing, please understand what svglet is and what it is not.

### svglet is:
- A lightweight, vanilla JavaScript library
- Focused on organizing and injecting SVG icons
- Designed to work naturally with CSS and Tailwind
- Dependency-free and framework-agnostic

### svglet is NOT:
- A styling or animation framework
- A replacement for CSS
- A complex abstraction layer
- A framework-specific solution

**Keeping this philosophy intact is a top priority.**

## 🧭 Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the project locally**: `git clone https://github.com/hernandez-ajhc/svglet.git`
3. **Create a new branch for your work**: `git checkout -b my-feature`
4. **Make your changes**, following the guidelines below.
5. **Test your changes** using the examples in `examples/`.
6. **Commit your changes with a clear message**: `git commit -m "Add meaningful description"`
7. **Push your branch**: `git push origin my-feature`
8. **Open a Pull Request** and reference the related issue.

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open a GitHub issue using the Bug Report template.

**Bug reports must include:**
- The affected version (mandatory)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Browser and environment details (if relevant)

*Incomplete reports may be closed.*

## 🚀 Feature Requests & Enhancements

All new features and improvements must go through an issue first.

**Rules:**
- Every issue must reference a target version
- The version must appear in the title and labels
- Scope must be clearly defined
- Avoid feature creep and over-engineering

If you are unsure whether something fits svglet, open a discussion issue first.

## 🏷️ Issues & Labels

We use labels to keep the project organized.

**Mandatory:**
- Version label (e.g. `v0.8.0`)

**Common labels:**
- `feature`
- `bug`
- `enhancement`
- `dx`
- `performance`
- `documentation`
- `discussion`
- `planned`
- `good first issue`
- `help wanted`

*Issues without a version label may be closed.*

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/`: Core source code
- `dist/`: Build output (when applicable)
- `docs/`: Documentation
- `examples/`: Usage and demo examples

*Please keep changes focused and avoid unrelated modifications.*

## 🧑💻 Coding Standards

- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- No external dependencies
- No framework-specific code
- Keep APIs minimal and predictable
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

*If a change increases complexity, it must be justified.*

## ⚠️ Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- Vanilla JavaScript only
- No mandatory build step
- No breaking changes without discussion
- Backward compatibility is a priority
- Performance and DX matter

## 📄 Documentation Contributions

Documentation improvements are highly encouraged.

**This includes:**
- README updates
- Usage examples
- Clarifying edge cases
- Fixing typos or inconsistencies

*Good documentation is considered a valuable contribution.*
